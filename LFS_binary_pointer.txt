When cloning binary LFS files, such as the .mat and .fig files, gitkraken may only pull the pointer
txt files. If this happens the cloned binary files will become just 3 lines of text with the pointer
information (open as txt to check this). To solve this, delete the cloned repo and clone manually via
bash. Just to remind the notation:

Right-click on the folder where the repo will be cloned, choose "Git Bash Here" and type:

$git clone https://github.com/brenotakiuti/RepoName.git

or

$git clone "https adress"

This problem may be caused by bad LFS installation or something like that. Right now I'm not in the 
mood to fix this, so this is a simple and quick solution. Cloning with LFS does not take long even for
large files (that's exactly what LFS is supposed to do) so in 20min you can clone all your repos from
scratch.
