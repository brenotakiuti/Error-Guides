When getting an authentication error, something like "failed to get certificate" and a portuguese description (dont know why portuguese):

1 - Delete all SSH keys;
2 - Check github settings to see if there are any SSH key left;
3 - Disconnect github from gitkraken;
4 - Reconnect;
5 - Generate new SSH key;

If this does not work:

3.5 - Disconnect github on html (site);

This problems is probably caused by some forwarding or proxy problem. In univerity(ies) or other institutions
you are not connected directtly to the internet, which implies in some kind of filter or firewall that blocks
direct https requests. Probably this cant be solved as long as you are in such place. Therefore you are forced
to use SSH keys.

For any opperations that require the use of URL instead of SSH, the server will block your connection. One 
example is when using submodules. You will have to pull each submodule manually.
