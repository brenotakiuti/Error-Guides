files, try:

	1 - in shell (git terminal) "git config --global credential.helper wincred"
	2 - disconnect from host server in preferences;
	3 - close gitkraken or any GUI and open again;
	4 - connect to host;
	5 - pull any folder anywhere (must be a full pull, not an already updated pull, 
		since it needs to actually pull something;
	6 - retry;
	7 - if does not work, restart in 1 following different order of execution.
